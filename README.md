This assesment includes the climate discussions set out during the summer of 2019 and shown on the webpage klimaaftalen.tokni.com

To obtain the model, including the TIMES source code, run the following command:
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/energy-modelling-club/TIMES-DK_COMETS

To run a specific scenario (e.g. Frozen_policy_scenarie) execute the following command from root:
> GAMS runmodel --comets_scenario=Frozen_policy_scenarie
